**Basic Python Solutions**

1. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

Soultion:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        num_to_index = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_to_index:
                return [num_to_index[complement], i]
            num_to_index[num] = i
        raise ValueError("No two sum solution exists")
```

2. Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 Soultion:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1

```
